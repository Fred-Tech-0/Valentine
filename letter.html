                <p><b>To my most favorite person,</b></p>
                <p>As I sit here writing this, I am overwhelmed by the journey we have shared. It is not often that two souls find a connection that feels as effortless and profound as ours. From the moment we met, my world began to shift in the most beautiful ways...</p>
                <p>You are my constant, my calm in the middle of a storm, and the person I want to wake up to every single morning. I love the way we laugh at things no one else understands. I love how you are committed to me and how you support me...</p>
                <p>Thank you for choosing me. I love you more than yesterday, but less than I will tomorrow.</p>
                <p><b>Always Yours.</b></p>
